# Dashboard-on-Bank-Loan-Report

### I'm excited to share my latest project, where I used Power BI to transform complex bank loan data into useful insights!

üîç Objective:
The primary goal was to design a Details Dashboard that acts as a one-stop solution for analyzing loan data. This dashboard provides users with:
‚úÖ Comprehensive insights into the loan portfolio
‚úÖ Borrower profiles and segmentation
‚úÖ Loan performance metrics

üí° Key Highlights:
A user-friendly interface that simplifies data exploration.
Real-time analytics for better decision-making.
Visualizations that make patterns and trends understandable.

üí° Key Features:
1. Unique Identifiers: Using fields like Loan ID to ensure accurate tracking and analysis of individual loans.
2. Geographic Insights: Analyzing borrower data by Address State to understand regional trends and manage risks.
3. Borrower Stability Metrics: Looking at the fields such as Employee Length and Home Ownership to evaluate financial stability.
4. Risk Assessment: Using Grade and Sub Grade classifications to analyze creditworthiness and lending terms.
5. Loan Details: Including key metrics like Interest Rate, DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio), and Instalment to show loan affordability and performance.

üí°Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
1. Total Loan Applications: Includes Month-to-Date (MTD) applications and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for better monitoring.
2. Total Funded Amount: Tracks the total disbursed funds with MTD and MoM analytics.
3. Total Amount Received: Assesses the bank‚Äôs cash flow by analyzing repayments received with MTD and MoM changes.
4. Average Interest Rate: Measures the overall cost of lending, including MTD and MoM fluctuations.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluates borrower financial health through average DTI metrics with MTD and MoM insights.

I utilized DAX language in Power BI, employing functions such as SUM, CALCULATE, and various time intelligence functions to create this insightful dashboard.
